# FoRC: Field of Research Classification

The FoRC shared task aims to classify scientific documents into (sub-)topics according to a predefined schema. The second iteration of the task (see [NSLP 2024](https://nfdi4ds.github.io/nslp2024/docs/forc_shared_task.html) for the first) will focus on classifying computational linguistics publications taken from the ACL Anthology using the FoRC4CL data and taxonomy. Weakly supervised data will added to FoRC4CL to create a bigger training corpus for classifying publication into 170 (sub-)topics of computational linguistics.
